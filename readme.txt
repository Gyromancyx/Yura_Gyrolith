Thank you for downloading Yura Sashoune Gyrolith!

Gyrolith is a VCCV format German database. The notation is based on YumeWei's German VCCV format, with slight differences
Please refer to the linked phoneme documentation

As of release, there is no dedicated German Phonemizer. I recommend (mis)using Mim's French CVVC phonemizer and using the phoneme hint function to force CC transition recognition and vowel placement
Please refer to the ustx provided alongside the release video for example of this usage

Info:

[6] denotes the diphthong ending /r/ and is used in a [VC C] format, i.e. [i6 m]. The VCC are present for all fricative and nasal consonants. For plosive consonants, please use the glottal occlusion version [VC ']. For glottal stops, please use the glottal stop version [VC .].

[a .a] = VV combination with glottal stop in between. For usage, add the point at the consonant point of the [V V]

[a .] = glottal end stop

[. a] = glottal beginning

[a -] = end breath. Primarily used to make the endings of vowels softer

[a -hh] = end breath with exaggerated breathiness

[a -hhi] = end breath followed by a breathing in. Can be used to mimic the breathing in between words.
